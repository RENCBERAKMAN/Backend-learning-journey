# Microservices Learning Project 🚀

This project is my personal backend project, started to learn Spring Boot and microservices architecture, and to gain hands-on experience.🚀

# 🎯 Goal:

Build a structure where independent services operate separately

Explore user authentication using JWT and security mechanisms

Learn data management with PostgreSQL and JPA

Improve code reliability using testing culture

Understand routing and control mechanisms between services via API Gateway

# ⚙️ Technologies Used

Java 21 – To explore modern language features

Spring Boot 3.5.x – For rapid prototyping and microservices experience

Spring Data JPA – To manage database operations

PostgreSQL – Learning-oriented relational database

Spring Security & JWT – Token-based user authentication and security

Spring Cloud Gateway – Experience in API routing

JUnit / Spring Boot Test – To ensure code reliability

Postman – Testing API endpoints

# 💡 Notes

This project is completely for learning and experimentation.

It is still in progress; new features will be added and tests will be expanded.

I continuously develop the code using trial-and-error and testing culture.
